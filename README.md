# CSDM Java Assignment :memo:

This repository (accessible at [/behnam7171/csdm_java](https://github.com/behnam7171/csdm_java)) contains assignment for a book store using Java spring boot and h2 in-memory RDBMS.

You need to install JDK 11, Maven latest version
To run just simply run the CsdmJavaApplication.java in the application using your IDE.

If you installed java and maven and also set the environment variables (for windows read [here](https://mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/))

Or you can <code>mvn spring-boot:run</code> to run the application after installing maven.

All the bonus points are implemented including GraphQL, books can have multiple authors, integration tests. Also tried to name variables and methods properly and put comments to make it clear for the reader.
